# Connecting the YF-S201 sensor to arduino
## Water Flow Sensor

## Connecting to the board

The sensor is equipped with 3 contacts:
- Red, power 5v
- Black, earth
- Yellow, interrupt

Red connects to 5v
Black connects to the port *GND*
Yellow connects to the port 2

In the factory supply, the sensor is supplied with a plug, but it is not possible to connect it to the board in this way, so connecting wires of the papa-mama type are necessary.

### Sensor Feature

It is worth paying attention to the fact that the sensor has the direction of water flow.
